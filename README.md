A quick little project designed to get my feet wet with Minecraft
modding.

The initial goal was simple:

- Add "Unobtainium Armor" to Minecraft 1.18.1

To make this mod even simpler,

- The Unobtainium itself came from an existing 1.18 mod,
[Mythic Metals](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mythicmetals)

- The Unobtainium armor texture came from an old (1.12 Forge) mod,
[Extended Items and Ores](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/extended-items-and-ores-mod)

which left me with nothing to do except follow [some tutorials](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:armor).

For the fun of it, I've made Unobtainium armor give _super powerful_ protection, but
then nerfed it to have extremely low durability.

This mod absolutely requires Fabric. It is extremely unlikely I will make a version
for Forge. That being said, I'll probably update this mod to 1.19 once the rest of the
mods my family relies on are upgraded.

## Setup and Use

1. Install Minecraft 1.18.1, Fabric and the Fabric API
2. Install the [Mythic Metals](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mythicmetals)
   mod for 1.18.1 along with all its dependencies.
3. Install the [BetterEnd mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/betterend) for 1.18 and the corresponding 
   version of [BCLib](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/bclib).
3. Download this mod from the [release page](https://github.com/OpenBagTwo/UnobtainiumArmor/releases)
   and drop it into your mods folder.
4. Get yourself some unobtainium and get crafting!
