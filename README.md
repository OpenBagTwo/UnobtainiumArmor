# Unobtainium Armor

This is a toy project designed to get my feet wet with Minecraft
modding.

My goal is simple:

- Add "Unobtainium Armor" to Minecraft.

and I'm making it even simpler on myself by sourcing the Unobtainium
from an existing mod,
[Mythic Metals](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mythicmetals)

## Setup and Use

lol, I'll you know when I've actually built something
